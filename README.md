# Interactive Data Visualization for the Web: An Introduction to Designing with D3

Published by O'Reilly Media, this book has all the basics of using d3 to create data vizualizations covered.
In this repository I'll save the different exercises and examples I find through the book. 

Let's get started!

## Alternatives to D3
D3 is great but having more options never killed anyone, this could work in case you need to work with older browsers, need a more private way to store your data or a more exploratory to play with graphs without the commitment D3 requires.

### Easy Charts
[DataWrapper](https://www.datawrapper.de/gallery) : Create viz online and publish it anywhere

[Flot](http://www.flotcharts.org/) :  

[Peity](http://benpickles.github.io/peity/) : Makes very small visualizations. Kind of cute.

[Timeline.js](https://timeline.knightlab.com/) : Creates Timelines with little effort.


### Graph Visualization
[Arbor.js]()

[Cytoscape.js]()

[Sigma.js]()

### Geo-Mapping
[Kartograph](http://kartograph.org/showcase/clustering/) : A framework that creates beautiful maps.

[Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) : You can use this tool to create geomapping viz with D3. *Keep that in mind!*

[Polymaps](http://polymaps.org/) : A great tool also created by Bostock. Nevertheless using D3 + the [d3-tile-plugin](https://github.com/d3/d3-tile) can have better results.
